### ARIMA Model (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) <br>
AutoRegressive (AR): It captures the relationship between a current observation and a certain number of previous observations (lags). The AR part of ARIMA is described by the parameter 'p', which determines the number of lags to consider.
