### 1. ARIMA Model (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) <br>
The ARIMA model is generally represented as ARIMA (p,d,q), where p,d, and q are the parameters described below. ARIMA model is a combination of autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components that help to capture the patterns and 
1. AutoRegressive (AR): It captures the relationship between a current observation and a certain number of previous observations (lags). The AR part of ARIMA is described by the parameter 'p', which determines the number of lags to consider.
2. Integrated (I): It is used to make the time series stationary by differencing the data. The I part is described by the parameter 'd', which determines the order of differencing.
3. Moving Average (MA): It captures the relationship between a current observation and a moving average of previous erros (residuals). The MA part is described by the parameter 'q', which determines the order of the moving average. <br> <br>

ARIMA(p, d, q): Δ^d Y(t) = c + φ1 * Δ^d Y(t-1) + ... + φp * Δ^d Y(t-p) + ε(t) - θ1 * ε(t-1) - ... - θq * ε(t-q)
