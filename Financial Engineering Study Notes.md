### 1. ARIMA Model (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) <br>
The ARIMA model is generally represented as ARIMA (p,d,q), where p,d, and q are the parameters described below. ARIMA model is a combination of autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components that help to capture the patterns and 
1. AutoRegressive (AR): It captures the relationship between a current observation and a certain number of previous observations (lags). The AR part of ARIMA is described by the parameter 'p', which determines the number of lags to consider.
2. Integrated (I): It is used to make the time series stationary by differencing the data. The I part is described by the parameter 'd', which determines the order of differencing.
3. Moving Average (MA): It captures the relationship between a current observation and a moving average of previous erros (residuals). The MA part is described by the parameter 'q', which determines the order of the moving average. <br> <br>

ARIMA(p, d, q): Δ^d Y(t) = c + φ1 * Δ^d Y(t-1) + ... + φp * Δ^d Y(t-p) + ε(t) - θ1 * ε(t-1) - ... - θq * ε(t-q)

### 2. Black-Scholes Model <br>
It is a mathematical formula that helps investors and traders estimate the fair value of an option. It takes into account several factors, including the current price of the underlying asset, the option's strike price, the time until expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and <ins> the expected volatility (implied volatility) </ins> of the underlying asset.
