* Prepayment <br/> <br/>
  - The prepayment option gives the borrower or issuer the flexibility to pay off the debt early. This can be beneficial for several reasons, such as reducing the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan, freeing up cash flow for other investments or expenses, or taking advantage of lower interest rates. <br/>
However, prepayment options may come with certain restrictions or penalties, such as a prepayment fee or a minimum time period before the prepayment is allowed.
